first imports the necessary libraries to make web requests, parse HTML, interact with MongoDB, and manage time operations. It then connects to a local MongoDB database called 'stock_data' and selects a collection named 'nyse_stocks' to store the data. The key part is the 'fetch_stock_data' function which constructs a URL to scrape Yahoo Finance's "Most Active Stocks" page, mimics a browser's user agent, makes an HTTP request, and parses the result with BeautifulSoup to extract vital info like symbol, name, price, change etc for each stock. This extracted data is inserted into the MongoDB collection. Finally, an infinite while loop continuously calls this function every 3 minutes to fetch the latest stock data from Yahoo Finance and refresh the 'nyse_stocks' collection with updated documents.
